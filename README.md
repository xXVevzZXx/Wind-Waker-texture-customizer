### Tutorial

This is a very simple Programm, but there are some things you need to prepare for it to get it to work.
firstly you need to put the Programm Jar file into a Folder since it creates some directorys in its current directory.
After you have done that, you need to get a source texture of Link. Currently the only texture working for this is the Link texture from Hypatia which you can get here http://onthegreatsea.tumblr.com/DOWNLOADS.
When you get into the Programm there is a button which wants you to select a source. Click on it and select the png in this directory:
"GZLE01\Characters\Link\01  Normal Link/tex1_160x96_6ae2a887601ba80b_14.png" for Links textures.

After you have done that you can select the colors of your liking and click on "Generate Textures" and after that the generated texture will be saved in the programms folder under textures and you can copy it to "Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\GZLE01\" or "Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\GZLR01\" for the WW Randomizer.

### Updates

More models other than Link will be coming soon so check back later again :)
