### Tutorial

This is a very simple Programm, but there are some things you need to prepare for it to get it to work.
firstly you need to put the Programm Jar file into a Folder since it creates some directorys in its current directory.

All Base Textures used are from Hypatia:

After you have done that you can open the Programm, select the colors of your liking and click on "Generate Textures", then the generated texture will be saved in the programms folder under textures and you can copy it to "Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\GZLE01\" or "Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\GZLR01\" for the WW Randomizer. Also make sure to enable Custom textures in Dolphin.

### Updates

More models other than Link will be coming soon so check back later again :)

### Bugs

It would be great if you could report any bugs you may find to me on Discord: Sarah#0929.
